# Project Basic Button
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em> 

## 🎯 Objective
Create a default button that can be used in any project with only simple edits 

## 📝 Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a simple button that can be used for any project as a template

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- Basic HTML5 Button and Semantic syntax 
- Simple CSS3 Styling 
- Visual Studio Code 
- Chrome Web Browser 

## 📌 Outcome
With the project all finished, here are the final results:
- A light periwinkle background 

- A button with the words "Click Me" on them matched with a light purple background and black text 

- A blue color change once the user hovers over it 

- Then last but not least, the user is able to click on the button when it turns reddish-pink 

The screenshot can be located here:

## 🔍 Reflection
Completing this button was easier than expected. The only issue I really had was trying to make the button clickable. After doing some research, I was able to understand how the translateY() property worked thus solving the problem.
