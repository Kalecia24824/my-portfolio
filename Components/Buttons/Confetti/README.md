## 🔍 Reflection
This was one of my favorite projects to do. Since I practiced with buttons, the HTML was easy enough to set up. I had an easier time with CSS this go around because I chose to play around with each CSSproperty to understand how they worked. As for the JavaScript, I will say creating the event was simple after some research. The only issue I encountered forgetting to add an confetti script effect. Overall if I add to do this again, I want the button to stay on the page during the effect.
